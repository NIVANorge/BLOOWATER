# BLOOWATER
Repository for the BLOOWATER project (https://www.bloowater.eu/) 

BLOOWATER project aims to produce informational resources for Public water supply and Agencies to prepare and respond to the risk of the cyanotoxins in drinking water. Practically, the project proposes innovative technological solutions that are aimed to develop a methodological approach based on the integration of monitoring techniques and treatment of water affected by toxic blooms (multiple-barrier approach).

BLOOWATER will integrate innovative methodologies into a multisensor platform to improve water quality through the development of effective low-cost and functional measures into prompt and opportune intervention procedures for efficient and sustainable management of the water resource.
