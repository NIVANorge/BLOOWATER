Dataset for Lake Vansjø. 
Catchment map (690 km2). Lake Vansjø is a large lake with two main basins (Storefjorden – 24km2 and Vanemfjorden – 12 km2).
The attached dataset is for Vanemfjorden (see attached hypsography for depths) includes catchment, lake and weather data.

and modelled inflow and water temperature: inflow into Storefjorden, outflow from Storefjorden into Vanemfjorden 
(connection between the two basins) and an additional inflow into Vanemfjorden (vanem subcatchment).

Lake modelled variables include temperature profiles, ice-off dates and outflow discharge.
The chemistry data include chl-a, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, SiO2, TOC, TOTN, TOTP, O2.
